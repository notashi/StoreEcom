# Global E-commerce store

To create my global e-commerce store, I used React.js, HTML, and CSS. React.js enabled me to build interactive components, while HTML provided the structure and CSS handled the styling. To enhance my project, I leveraged React DOM to render components to the browser, React Icons for visually appealing icons, and styled components for modular and maintainable styling. For state management, I opted for the Context API, which efficiently shared data between my components. Although larger projects may require additional state management libraries like Redux or MobX, I found the Context API suitable for my smaller to medium-sized e-commerce store. Overall, this combination of technologies allowed me to develop a dynamic and visually appealing global e-commerce store.
